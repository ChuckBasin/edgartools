## [3.10.3] - 2025-02-01

### Added
- Add class `CurrentReport` as the data object for the **8-K** and **6-K** forms
- Add class `SixK` as an alias for `CurrentReport`

### Changed
- `EightK` is now an alias for `CurrentReport`
- Plain text files are now read as text rather than html
- For Forms, **3**, **4**, **5** filings the html is downloaded from the filing homepage instead of from the SGML

### Fixed
- Made `pct_value` optional when parsing `FundReports` to avoid a ValidationError

## [3.10.2] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- Add `attachments.get_by_index` to get attachments by index. Indexing starts at 0. There is also `get_by_sequence` that starts at 1

### Changed
- Improved the styling of Attachments using emoticons for different file types
- Add descriptions of reports from the `FilingSummary.xml`
- Add getting attachment text using `attachment.text()`
- Getting attachments using`[]` uses `get_by_sequence` rather than `get_by_index`

### Fixed
- Fixed bug when calling `repr(FilingSGML)`


## [3.10.1] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- Improved rich styling of attachments
- Implement parsing of FilingSummary
- Implement getting content of individual SGML reports
- Implement viewing individual attachments in the SGML report e.g. balance sheet, income statement, etc.

### Changed
- `EDGAR_USE_LOCAL_DATA` now accepts more boolean values `'y', 'yes', 't', 'true', 'on', '1'` or `'n', 'no', 'f', 'false', 'off', '0'` to enable or disable local storage. This is to make it easier to set the environment variable in different environments.

## [3.10.0] - 2025-01-26

### Changed
- This release uses SGML as the primary means of getting attachments and text from SEC filings. This is a significant change from the previous release that used the Filing homepage and access the documents directly. This will make it work better with local storage

### Added
- Implement getting attachments from the SGML text file
- Implement getting html and xml from the SGML attachments
- Add uu_decode function to decode uuencoded files

### Fixed
- Download related filings from the SEC when local storage is enabled but not yet refreshed
- Return empty filings when no filings are found for a company

## [3.9.1] - 2025-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed bug when downloading data to local storage


## [3.9.0] - 2025-01-20


### Changed
- Refactored the code that used HTTPX client connections to reuse connections. Reusing HTTPX client connections yields about a 20ms savings per request in retrieval in limited tests. (Thanks to paul @ igmo)
- Consolidated the httpx client connection to a single edgartools.httpclient module. This will allow for more control over the client and the ability to pass the client explicitly to functions that need it.
- More logging statements when downloading filings to local storage
- Set throttling when listing the SEC filing bulk files
